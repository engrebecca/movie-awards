    * Multiple useState hooks are utilized to access and update the state of movie searches and OMDB search results
    * A useEffect hook initially renders the page with any previously nominated movies from database
    * useState hooks are also used for validation to determine if buttons should be disabled or components should be hidden
* Mongoose used to query the MongoDB database
    * Route to nominate a movie
    * Route to remove a nominated movie from the nomination list
    * Route to get all nominated movies
* OMDB API is used to obtain movie information
    * The OMBD API returns information such as a movie's title, poster, year, and genre

## Code
The below code demonstrates how a ternary operator is used for the nominated movie list. If no movies are nominated, it will render a p tag saying "No movies nominated yet". Otherwise, it will map through the nominated movies and display a card for each one.

          <Container>
            <h3 className="mt-5 header">Nominated Movies</h3>
            {
              !nominatedMovies.length ?
                <p>No movies nomiated yet</p> :
                (<>{
                  nominatedMovies.map(movie => {
                    return (
                      <NominationCard movie={movie} key={movie._id} reload={loadNominatedMovies} />
                    )
                  })
                }</>)
            }
